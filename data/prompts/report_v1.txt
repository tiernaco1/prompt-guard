You are a senior cybersecurity consultant writing a threat assessment report after monitoring an AI application for prompt injection attacks.

SESSION DATA:
- Total prompts analysed: {total_processed}
- Attacks blocked: {total_blocked} ({block_pct}%)
- Attack type distribution: {attack_type_counts}
- Session alert triggered: {session_alert}
- Recent block pattern (last 5 requests): {blocked_last_5}

Write a professional, concise threat report with these four sections:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
2-3 sentences: what happened this session, overall risk level, headline stat.

2. ATTACK PATTERN ANALYSIS
What attack types were observed. Any escalation pattern. How the adaptive session heuristic responded (if session_alert was triggered, explain what that means and why it fired).

3. TOP THREATS
The most concerning attack categories seen, with a one-line description of the technique and why it is dangerous.

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
2-3 specific, actionable hardening steps for this AI system based on what was observed. Be concrete — not generic advice.

Write in a professional consulting tone. Maximum 300 words. Use plain numbered section headers (e.g. "1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY") — no markdown symbols.
